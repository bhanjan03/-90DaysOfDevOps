# Introduction - Day 1

Welcome to the #90DaysOfDevOps Challenge 

## 1.What is DevOps:
   - DevOps combines development (Dev) and operations (Ops) to increase the efficiency, speed, and security of software development and delivery compared to traditional processes.
   - It aims to make the process faster, secure, and more efficient by fostering better collaboration between development and operations teams.This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.
   - It fosters collaboration and understanding to achieve continuous development, integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring of applications throughout the Software Development Lifecycle.
   - Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations.

## 2.What is Automation, Scaling, and Infrastructure:
    
	2.1. Automation : Automation means using tools and scripts to perform repetitive tasks with less human intervation. For example, my current project needs to test its functionality every time a new feature is added. Instead of manually testing, we use automated tools to create a script and run that script quickly and accurately. This saves time and reduces the chance of human error.
            How automation releated to the Devops
                Automated Code Deployment: Instead of manually updating software on each server, automation tools deploy new code automatically.
                Automated Testing: Software tests run on their own after code is written, ensuring new features work correctly without waiting for manual checks.
                Routine Maintenance: Tasks like backups or system updates are handled automatically at set intervals. Automation makes tasks faster and more reliable, freeing up human effort for 
                                    more creative and strategic work.
                Monitroing the server:- Automation script will monitor the server if any thing unexpected error it find finds, it will inform respective team members.

    2.2. Scaling refers to the ability to increase or decrease the capacity of your systems based on demand. It ensures that services remain efficient and responsive as usage grows or shrinks.
                Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up): Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.
                Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out): Adding more servers to distribute the load. Scaling helps maintain performance and availability during peak usage times and saves costs 
                                                  during low usage periods.
    2.3. Infrastructure:
            Infrastructure is the foundation that supports all your digital activities, much like the roads, bridges, and utilities that support a city:
            Physical Servers and Networks: The physical machines and cables that connect them, forming the backbone of your computing environment.
            Virtual Machines and Cloud Services: Software-based resources that can be scaled up or down as needed, provided by cloud platforms like AWS or Azure.
            Software Tools: Databases, middleware, and other tools that help run applications smoothly. A robust infrastructure ensures your applications are reliable, scalable, and always available to users.
    
	- In short:
            - Automation: Uses technology to handle repetitive tasks.
            - Scaling: Adjusts resources to meet demand.
            - Infrastructure: The essential foundation for running applications and services.
## 3.Why DevOps is Important:
    
	- Faster Delivery:-
            - Speed: DevOps practices like automation and CI/CD allow for rapid development and frequent releases, getting new features and fixes to users quickly.
    
	- Better Collaboration:-
            - Unified Teams: DevOps fosters collaboration between development and operations teams, leading to better communication and shared responsibility for the product.
    
	- Higher Quality and Reliability:-
            - Automated Testing: Continuous testing and consistent environments catch bugs early and ensure that software works well across different stages, reducing errors in production.
    
	- Increased Efficiency:-
            - Reduced Manual Tasks: Automating repetitive tasks saves time and resources, allowing teams to focus on innovation and complex problem-solving.
